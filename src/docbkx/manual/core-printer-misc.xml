It is always good advise to use more parentheses than you think you need. They
may not be needed, but they add clarity and don't cost anything.

<listitem>
<para id="misc-insert-uid">
Insert serial version UID
</para>
<indexterm zone="misc-insert-uid"><primary>Serial version UID</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Common sense dictates to declare an explicit serial version UID in every
serializable class to eliminate the serial version UID as a potential source
of incompatibility (with the additional benefit of a small performance gain).
If this switch is enabled and the class directly dereives from either
<filename>java.io.Serializable</filename> or <filename>java.io.Externalizable</filename>,
Jalopy computes and inserts a serial version UID for the class.
</para>
<para>
For this feature to work, the class that has its serial version UID computed
needs to be available on the classpath.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para id="misc-logging-conditional">
Insert logging conditional
</para>

<para>
Typically, logging systems have a method that submits a logging message like

<screen>
logger.debug("some message: " + someVar);
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This is fine, but if the debug level is set such that this message will
<emphasis>NOT</emphasis> display, then time is wasted doing the string marshalling.
</para>

<para>
Thus, the preferred way to do this is

<screen>
if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
    logger.debug("some message: " + someVar);
}
</screen>

which will only use CPU time if the log message is needed. Enabling this switch
will ensure that every logging call with the debug level set will be enclosed with
the conditional expression.
</para>

<para>
Use this feature with care! The current implementation only supports the Jakarta
Log4J toolkit and is somewhat weak in that every method call called
<firstterm>debug</firstterm> is treated as a logging call which could be incorrect
in your application. However, it works fine for the <firstterm>l7dlog</firstterm> calls.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para id="misc-trailing-newline">
Insert trailing newline
</para>
<para>
If enabled, Jalopy inserts an empty line at the end of every file. This may
help to avoid problems with certain text formatters and processors.
</para>
<para>
Note that Jalopy always inserts at least one empty line after footers, so there
is no real need (but it doesn't hurt) to check the mark in case footer insertion
will be performed (see <xref linkend="footer" />)

<para id="misc-array-brackets">
Array brackets after identifiers

Lets you choose where the brackets of array types should be placed.

By default, Jalopy prints the square brackets right after the array type.
</para>

<example id="ex-misc-array-brackets">

int[] a;

But C/C++ programmers may expect them to appear after the identifier.

<para>
Force formatting
</para>
<para>
Jalopy can keep track of which files have been formatted previously.
See <xref linkend="misc-history" /> below. If History is enabled, Jalopy will
exclude files that have a modification date coincident with the last formatting.
However, you can override this history check to force a format. For example,
you might need to update the copyright notice for the whole code base. Enabling
this switch ensures that all source files are always be formatted. Note that
this switch is only meaningful if the history feature is enabled.

<sect3 id="misc-history">
<title>History</title>

<indexterm><primary>History</primary></indexterm>

<para>
The history feature offers a way to optimize the speed at which Jalopy processes
of a group of files repeatedly. Using history, Jalopy is able to track file
modifications between successive invocations, and only format those source
files which have actually changed, or which weren't processed previously.
This can save a huge amount of execution time for a project that is formatted
repeatedly over time. There are two methods for keeping history.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para id="history-file">
Use history file
</para>

<indexterm zone="history-file"><primary>History</primary><secondary>file</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm zone="history-file"><primary>File-based history</primary></indexterm>
<para>
If you can't get along with a history header comment at the top of each source
file, but would like historical optimization, the file-based approach may work
for you. The history information of previous formatting will be saved in a file
<filename>history.dat</filename> under the Jalopy settings directory.
</para>

<para>
Note that this file will grow over time, especially if one manages several big
projects. So the history file could become quite huge. As all history entries
are read into memory at startup, it could eat up quite a bit of memory space.
Therefore a little history viewer is provided which enables you to selectively
remove obsolete entries.
</para>

<para>
In order to effectively use formatting of a project with several developers it is
nice to be able to only format files which have changed. There are three methods of
working out if a file has changed provided in a drop down. Timestamp will use the
modification time of the file, this does not work very well with source control
and multiple developers. There are two standard checksums available. These
work by taking a checksum of the file and comparing it to the one in the history file.
If this checksum is different, the file is parsed and formatted in memory and a new
checksum calculated. If the new checksum is different than the checksum for the
unformatted file, it is written to disk. This stops files that have just been updated
from source control from having being formatted (and timestamps updated).
</para>

<para>
Use the <guibutton>View...</guibutton> button to display the history viewer. You
can selectively remove entries via the popup menu.

<indexterm zone="history-comment"><primary>Comments</primary><secondary>for history</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm zone="history-comment"><primary>Comment-based history</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Jalopy will insert a small comment in the first line of every source file.
The comment encodes the time a file was last formatted along with the package
name of the file. This method is precise and relatively foolproof but does not work well
with SCM tools.

<sect3 id="misc-backup">
<title>Backup</title>
<para>
For security reasons Jalopy creates a backup copy of the currently
processed file so it can be restored in case a severe error occured during the
formatting process. The original file is stored in the backup directory and normally
deleted after the newly formatted file has been successfully written.
</para>

<itemizedlist>

The backup level defines how many numbered backups should be retained (up to 30).
The default is to never hold any backups.
