Jalopy stores its settings in a binary file

However you can import/export your settings in both the binary, and a textual

<title>Import/Export</title>
<para>
Use the <guibutton>Import...</guibutton> and <guibutton>Export...</guibutton>
buttons to import an already-saved code convention, or export your current settings as
a new code convention. You can choose between the binary <filename>.jal</filename> format
or an XML representation.
</para>

<para>
Jalopy is able to import settings from both local and distributed locations.
Just specify a valid Internet address (either starting with <firstterm>http://</firstterm> or
<firstterm>www.</firstterm>) for the latter. Jalopy will then attempt to synchronize
its settings with the given url on every invocation. That way it is easy to
share a single code convention across a group of developers.
</para>

<para>
Please note that versions prior to 1.0b8 stored the backup directory always as
an absolute file. Therefore after importing a code convention, you should
check whether this directory points to your preferred backup directory. This
advice holds true even for later versions in case you've changed the default
backup directory.
</para>

<para>
However if the backup directory setting is left untouched, the directory is
stored relative to the Jalopy settings directory. This way you can savely
share your code convention across different systems and platforms.
